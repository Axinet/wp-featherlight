## Description ##

WP Featherlight is a WordPress plugin wrapper for the Featherlight jQuery lightbox plugin. When installed, the plugin will automatically display all standard WordPress images and galleries in a simple, minimalistic lightbox popup. It's also possible to load Videos, iframes, and ajax content using WP Featherlight by adding data attributes to your content. For more details on custom content loading, check out the [featherlight documentation](https://github.com/noelboss/featherlight/#usage).

There are no settings for WP Featherlight, so you should be able to install it without needing to configure anything. In the event you don't want a lightbox on certain pages or posts, there is an option to disable it from within the post editor screen.

Here's an example of the plugin being used to load a large (5mb) external image in a standard WordPress post:
